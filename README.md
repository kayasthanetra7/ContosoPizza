# ContosoPizza
Web API application with ASP.NET Core, controllers that implement basic CRUD logic.



Example Scenario

Suppose you're an employee of a pizza company named Contoso Pizza. Your manager has asked you to develop a RESTful pizza inventory management service as a prerequisite for the company's web storefront and mobile application. The service has to support adding, viewing, modifying, and removing types of pizzaâ€” a standardized usage of HTTP action verbs better known as Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD).
